	Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br />
	Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore.<br />
	While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br />
	As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br />
	“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door.<br />
	Only this and nothing more.”
